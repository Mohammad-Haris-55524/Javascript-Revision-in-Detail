    <h3>HTTP method</h3>
    <h4>>HTTP Methods (or HTTP Verbs):
        HTTP methods specify the action the client wants to perform on the identified resource. They are part of the request line and indicate whether the client wants to retrieve information, submit data, or perform other operations.
        Common HTTP methods include:
        <br>GET: Retrieve data from a specified resource.
        <br>POST: Submit data to be processed to a specified resource.
        <br>PUT: Update a resource or create it if it doesn't exist.(Go ON JS CODE TO FIND BETTER EXPLANATION B/W PUT VS PATCH)
        <br>DELETE: Delete a specified resource.

        The properties "Header," "Body," and "Method" are associated with the structure and components of an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) message. HTTP is a protocol used for communication between web browsers and servers. Let's break down how these properties relate to HTTP:
    </h5>
        <ul>
            <li> Header:
                - The "Header" is a part of an HTTP message that contains metadata about the request or response. HTTP headers are represented as key-value pairs and provide additional information about the data being sent or received. Examples of headers include `Content-Type`, `User-Agent`, and `Authorization`. Headers are present in both HTTP requests and responses.
            </li>
            <br>
             <li>Body:(CHECK JS FOR BODY EXPLANATION)
                - The "Body" is another part of an HTTP message, specifically the part that carries the actual data being transmitted. In an HTTP request, the body contains data sent by the client to the server (e.g., form data or JSON payload). In an HTTP response, the body contains the data or resource requested by the client (e.g., HTML content or JSON data).
             </li> 
             <br>
            <li>
                Method:
                - The "Method" refers to the HTTP method or HTTP verb used in an HTTP request. The HTTP method specifies the intended action to be performed on a resource identified by a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). Common HTTP methods include `GET` (retrieve data), `POST` (submit data), `PUT` (update or create a resource), `PATCH` (partially update a resource), and `DELETE` (delete a resource).
             </li>
         </ul>
         <summary>These properties collectively define the structure, content, and intended operation of an HTTP message. The combination of headers, body, and method allows clients and servers to communicate effectively and perform various actions on web resources.</summary>
