      <h3>WHAT IS OPTIMAL CHAINING</h3>
      <p>
        Optional chaining (?.) is a feature introduced in ECMAScript 2020 (ES11)
        that allows you to access properties of an object without the need to
        explicitly check if each level of nested properties exists. It helps to
        simplify code and avoid errors caused by accessing properties of null or
        undefined. Optional chaining (?.) is not limited to objects only. It can also be used with arrays and function calls.
      </p>
      <p>
        Optional chaining can be combined with the nullish coalescing operator
        (??) to provide a default value if the result is null or undefined.
      </p>
      <P>
        You are correct, optional chaining (?.) does not work on root-level properties of objects in JavaScript. It's designed to work with nested properties, arrays, and function calls.
        
        If you try to use optional chaining on a root-level property, it won't throw an error, but it will simply return undefined. This is because there's no preceding property or object to check for existence.</P>
      <p>
        <h4>Why Use Optional Chaining?</h4>
        <ul><li>Simplified Code: It reduces the need for
            verbose null/undefined checks, making the code cleaner and more
            readable.</li>
        <li>Avoid Errors: It helps to prevent errors like "Cannot read
            property 'x' of undefined" by gracefully handling missing properties or
            nested properties.</li>
        <li> Concise Syntax: It provides a concise syntax for
            accessing nested properties, function calls, and array elements in a
            safe manner.</li></ul> 
            <summary>Overall, optional chaining improves code robustness and
                readability by simplifying property access in scenarios where object
                properties may be missing or null/undefined.</summary>

    <div><h4>Boolean casting</h4>
    <p>In summary, boolean casting in JavaScript is a process of converting non-boolean values to boolean values.
    It is useful for conditional logic, type conversion, and comparison operations. It can be done implicitly
    or explicitly using functions like Boolean() or !!.</p>
