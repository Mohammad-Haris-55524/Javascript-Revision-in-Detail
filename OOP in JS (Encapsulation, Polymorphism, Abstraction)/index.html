      Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented
      programming (OOP). It involves bundling data (attributes) and methods
      (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class.
      The class serves as a blueprint for creating objects, and it hides the
      internal state and implementation details of its objects from the outside
      world. This way, the object's internal state can only be modified through
      its methods, ensuring data integrity and security.
    </h5>
    Understanding when to use getter and setter functions comes down to the
    design of your application and the requirements of your data model. Here are
    some considerations that can help you decide when to use getter and setter
    functions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        1. **Encapsulation and Data Integrity**: - Getter and setter functions
        are commonly used to encapsulate access to class properties, ensuring
        data integrity and providing controlled access to the properties. -
        Getter functions allow controlled access to retrieve the value of a
        property, while setter functions allow controlled access to modify the
        value of a property. - Use setter functions when you need to perform
        validation or execute logic before setting a property's value. This
        helps ensure that only valid data is assigned to the property.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. **Data Validation and Transformation**: - Setter functions are
        particularly useful for validating input data and transforming it if
        necessary before assigning it to a property. - For example, you might
        use a setter function to ensure that a numerical property is within a
        certain range, or to convert input data to a specific format before
        assigning it to a property.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. **Computed Properties**: - Getter functions can be used to compute or
        derive properties based on other properties' values. - For example, you
        might use a getter function to calculate the total price of a shopping
        cart based on the prices and quantities of individual items in the cart.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. **Access Control**: - Getter and setter functions can also be used to
        control access to private or protected properties, even though
        JavaScript does not have true access control mechanisms like some other
        languages.
      </li>
    </ul>

    Regarding your question about encapsulation and the use of getter and setter
    functions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Getter and setter functions are commonly used in encapsulation to
        protect the internal state of an object and ensure data integrity.
      </li>
      <li>
        - While encapsulation is a primary motivation for using getter and
        setter functions, they can also serve other purposes, such as data
        validation, transformation, and access control.
      </li>
      <li>
        - By using getter and setter functions, you can enforce constraints on
        the data being assigned to properties, ensuring that only valid data is
        used and preventing potential errors or unexpected behavior in your
        code.
      </li>
    </ul>
    In summary, while encapsulation is a key aspect of using getter and setter
    functions, they also offer additional benefits such as data validation,
    transformation, and access control, making them valuable tools for
    maintaining the integrity and reliability of your code.
